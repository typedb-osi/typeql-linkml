      The value must be a URI or a CURIE. In a Neo4j representation, the value should
      be the CURIE for the biolink class, for example biolink:Gene. For an RDF representation,
      the value should be a URI such as https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/Gene

      may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site,

    description: >-
      a concept or class in an ontology, vocabulary or thesaurus. Note that nodes in
      a biolink compatible KG can be considered both instances of biolink classes, and
      OWL classes in their own right. In general you should not need to use this class directly.
      Instead, use the appropriate biolink class. For example, for the GO concept of endocytosis (GO:0006897),
      use bl:BiologicalProcess as the type.

    comments:

        This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a
        node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative bioloink category, such as AnatomicalEntity
        (for Uberon classes), ChemicalSubstance (for CHEBI or CHEMBL), etc
      - >-
        Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
        but can be the object of 'type' edges. For example, if we had a node in the graph representing
        a specific brain of a specific patient (e.g brain001), this could have a category of bl:Sample,
        and by typed more specifically with an ontology class UBERON:nnn, which has as category bl:AnatomicalEntity

      Any ‘published’ piece of information. Publications are considered broadly

      books - as well as things like pre-prints, white papers, patents, drug 
      labels, web pages, protocol documents,  and even a part of a publication if

          Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred

          alternate CURIE otherwise. Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by
          'published in' node property) such as books and journals, should have
          industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN and ISSN.

          the 'title' of the publication is generally recorded in the 'name'
          property (inherited from NamedThing). The field name 'title' is now also
